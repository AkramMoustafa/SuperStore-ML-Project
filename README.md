"# SuperStore-ML-Project" 

This code was made as part of Summer 2023 in Alexandria  University. 
This project focuses on analyzing the "SuperStoreUS-2015" dataset by performing data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and building machine learning models to predict sales patterns. The main goal is to prepare and optimize the dataset, find useful information from the data, and classify sales into bins using both Decision Tree and Naive Bayes classifiers.

We also explore clustering using K-Means to group products based on selected attributes and visualize these clusters.
